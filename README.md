Ma'arul keyboard for Mac OS X
======

The Avar language (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avar_language) is usually written in the Cyrillic script. 
"Ӏ" symbol is absent in most of traditional Cyrillic layouts. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)
For this purposes I've added that into my own keyboard layout. It's 99% copy of traditional Russian keyboard layout, except one feature: you can write "Ӏ" symbol using option+i.
